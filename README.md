# 📝 Task Tracker Web App

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **Simple Task Tracker Web App** that allows users to:

-   Add new tasks
-   View task list
-   Mark tasks as completed
-   Delete tasks
-   Persist tasks using browser storage (Local Storage)
-   Use a clean, responsive UI
-   Host the finished site on **GitHub Pages**

This project is designed to help you practice **Git collaboration**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** equally. All trainees will rotate through different tasks to ensure balanced learning.

## 🧠 Skills You'll Practice

-   Using Git and GitHub (branching, pull requests, code reviews)
-   Writing semantic HTML and structuring a page
-   Styling with CSS (layout, colors, responsive design)
-   Programming with JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Local Storage)
-   Hosting with GitHub Pages
-   Writing clean, readable, and well-commented code

## 👨‍👩‍👦 Team Setup

You are a team of **3 trainees**. You will work collaboratively through GitHub.

-   One person creates the repository on GitHub and adds the others as collaborators.
-   Use **branches** to develop features and submit **Pull Requests (PRs)** for team review.
-   Use **meaningful commit messages** and make frequent commits.
